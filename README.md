Push-up counter using Arduino Nano 33 BLE and IMU sensor

# 🏋️ Push-Up Counter using Arduino Nano 33 BLE

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an **automatic push-up counter** using the **Arduino Nano 33 BLE**.  
It uses the **built-in IMU (accelerometer)** sensor to detect body movement during push-ups and
counts each correct repetition automatically.

This system eliminates manual counting and provides a **portable, low-cost, and accurate**
fitness monitoring solution.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To automatically count push-ups using motion sensors
- To avoid camera-based systems
- To build a wearable and portable fitness tracking device
- To ensure accurate counting using threshold-based logic
